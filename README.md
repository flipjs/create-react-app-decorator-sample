# create-react-app + mobx (using @decorator syntax)

This is a sample MobX application that uses @decorator syntax. It needs a custom [`react-scripts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts) which adds the babel-plugin [`babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy). Please refer to [mobxjs/mobx issue #521](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx/issues/521) on how to update `react-scripts`.

The example (Counter) used here is taken from [`create-react-app-mobx`](https://github.com/mobxjs/create-react-app-mobx) with the class definition modified to use the @decorator syntax.
